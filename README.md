ðŸš€ Loan Eligibility Prediction Project

Welcome to my loan eligibility prediction project! Here, I take you on a journey from raw data to an intelligent solution that predicts whether a customer qualifies for a home loan. Using a logistic regression model, this project makes the process of loan approvals faster, smarter, and more reliable.

ðŸ“– Overview

Dream Housing Finance Company operates across urban, semi-urban, and rural areas, offering home loans to customers. When someone applies for a loan, their eligibility is determined based on details like income, credit history, education, and more. This project automates that decision-making process by identifying customers who are most likely to be eligibleâ€”helping the company save time and target the right audience.

ðŸ¤” Why It Matters
This project doesnâ€™t just crunch numbers; it empowers businesses to make informed decisions faster, improving both customer experience and operational efficiency.

ðŸŒŸ Key Features
Handles data preprocessing, including encoding, scaling, and missing value treatment.
Provides real-time predictions for customer loan eligibility.
Simple, interpretable, and scalable for real-world applications.
